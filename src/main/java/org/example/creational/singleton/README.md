# Singleton

The Singleton pattern is a creational design pattern that ensures a class has only one instance, while providing a global access point to this instance.

An example scenario where the SIngleton pattern might be useful is in a system where you have a single configuration object that needs to be accessed by multiple parts of the application. This configuration object might contain information such as database connection settings, API keys or other application-wide settings.

Advantages:

-- It ensures that only one instance of a class is created, saving memory;

-- It provides a single point of access to that instance, allowing for easy global access to the object;

Disadvantages:

-- It can make unit testing more difficult, as the Singleton's state cannot be easily controlled or reset;

-- It can introduce global state to a program, which can make it harder to reason about the behaviour of individual parts of the code;

It's important to note that the singleton pattern should be used with care, as it can make code more difficult to reason about and test. It's also worth considering alternative patterns, such as dependecy injection, that can achieve similar results without introducing global state.
